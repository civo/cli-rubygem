# civo-cli in Docker

Build a docker container embedded with the latest civo command.  Note that it does NOT yet build from source;
it simply pulls the latest civo cli from RubyGems.  Usage is in the main repo's README.  The docker that builds 
from source is a work in progress and available at https://github.com/ssmiller25/cli/tree/dockerbuild
